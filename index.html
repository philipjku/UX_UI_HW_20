        <p>Ever since the pandemic, cross platforms have become a crucial necessity and as socialization has been hindered, many people claim to be experiencing social pressure. 
            Hence, we thought it would be necessary to find another social outlet, another opportunity to connect with people, while being safe.
        </p> 
        <p>We explored multiple alternatives to hone down on the best solution. Through our surveys and interviews, we observed the incline of music exploration and sharing. We wanted to create a more creative outlet to encourage relationship building and meeting new people. Playlist sharing and conversations with people of similar musical interests was our more creative solution to growing social connection and improving the usersâ€™ musical experience.

          As you can see the paragraphs gracefully wrap around the floated image. Now imagine how this would look with some actual content in here, rather than just this boring placeholder text that goes on and on, but actually conveys no tangible information at. It simply takes up space and should not really be read.
